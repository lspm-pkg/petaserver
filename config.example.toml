# Description: The size of each data chunk. This is the fundamental block size of your disk.
# Matters: This value is critical to how the disk is split into pieces.

# Default: 8388608 (exactly 8 MiB)
chunk_size = 8388608

# Description: A hard, brute-force limit on the number of Discord API requests per second.

# Default: true
one_account_mode = true
